# Bible Utilities

Bible Utilities currently has tools to scan free text for scripture references, and to consolidate the list of references it finds
to the smallest set.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/m6vkhcv9i74gdmm5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bloritsch/bibleutilities/branch/master)

* **NetCore 1.1** -- You can use it in just about any kind of project (store apps, standard apps, silverlight, Xamarin, etc.)
* **I18n Savvy** -- Currently support for English ("en") and Norwegian ("nb"), submissions for more languages welcome
* **Simple API** -- Patterned after C# libraries for ToString() and TryParse() variations, and it's easy to specify the language you want.
* **Multilingual App Toolkit** -- Uses [Microsoft's toolkit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/develop/multilingual-app-toolkit) to create the translations.

The goal of this small set of utilities is to simplify working with Bible references, parsing, etc.  We aren't going to include the actual
Bible content, but we'll make it easier to build apps around it.  If you have suggestions or need to report bugs, please use the Issues feature
on GitHub for this project.
